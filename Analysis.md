# Increasing the Female Customer Base for Citi Bike NYC 

An analysis was made of the January 2021 Citi Bike dataset.  This is the latest dataset that includes the sex and age of the customer base.  The most noticable observation was the sex ratio of the user population.  The male ridership was more than twice the size of the female ridership.  The purpose of the visualization is to illustrate the disparity between the sexes and where they occur in order to direct a campaign to increase the ridership among the female population.

There are 1,221 Citi Bike stations in New York City.  The top 20 most popular stations are taken as a sample.  All 20 of these stations are located in Manhattan from the Upper East Side towards south to Chinatown.  For most of theses stations, a plurality of bike journeys are round-trips.  At these stations, male riders make the majority of these trips.  This is true for all stations city-wide.  Male and female riders make up 71 and 29 percent of all known riders respectively.

If the goal is to increase female ridership, it is important to appeal to the women and girls of New York City.  A way to do this can be by surveying the women and girls in the  subscriber base.  Here are a few questions that could be asked.

* Are enough bikes avaivable at your station when needed?
* What will encourage you to ride a Citi Bike more?
* Are there any issues with the bikes that may discourage use?  Mechanical issues? Cleanliness?
* Are there any safety concerns with the bikes, surrounding areas, or routes?

Additional Observations
* Peak usage during the day happens during rush hours with most activity happening around 4 PM.  This information can be used in further study of bike availability during peak demand.
* Most users were around 30 years of age when the data was collected.  This could lead to an opportunity to promote bike usage to other age groups.
* The twenty least popular stations are located across the Bronx, near the LaGuardia airport, and in Sunset Park.  Further study could be conducted on what could be done to increase ridership in these areas.
